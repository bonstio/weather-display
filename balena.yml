  ****A real-time, miniature weather display based upon a Raspberry Pi / Zero and 256x64 SPI OLED display. Uses the publicly available [OpenWeatherMap One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api).**

  ## Highlights
    - **See local weather**: Display the current weather and forecast for your location. And on your commute.
  
    - **Highly configurable**: Customize many aspects of the display including which weather attributes you want to see.
  
    - **3D-printable cases**: The original 3D-printable cases still work perfectly for this project.
  
    - **Clear notification for rain**: If rain is forecast in the next 12h, the display shows an umbrella icon for your convenience.

  ## How to build
