The project is configured using environment variables. These can be set in your `docker-compose.yml` file for local development or in the balenaCloud dashboard for devices deployed in the fleet.

## API & Location Configuration

These variables control the connection to the OpenWeatherMap API, location settings, and units of measurement.

| `fps`                   | The target frames-per-second for display updates and animations. | `40`             |
| `updateIntervalSeconds` | How often (in seconds) to fetch new data from the weather API. | `1800` (30 mins) |
| `apiErrorSleepSeconds`  | How long (in seconds) to wait before retrying after an API connection error. | `30`             |
| `logIntervalSeconds`    | How often (in seconds) to log performance statistics. | `1800` (30 mins) |
| `forceRefresh`          | Set to `True` to force an API data refresh immediately on application start. | `False`          |
| `debug`                 | Set to `True` to enable detailed debug output in the logs. | `False`          |

## Display, Animation & Layout Configuration

| `scrollPauseSeconds` | How long (in seconds) to pause before and after scrolling long text. | `2` |
| `scrollOffScreenWaitSeconds` | How long (in seconds) to wait after text has scrolled completely off-screen before resetting. | `1` |
| `transitionDurationSeconds` | The duration (in seconds) of the screen transition effect. | `0.2` |
| `transitionEffect` | The animation effect used when changing views. Available options: `blink`, `wipe`. | `blink` |

| `weatherSlot1`<br>`weatherSlot2`<br>`weatherSlot3`<br>`weatherSlot4` | Sets the data to be shown in each of the four customizable slots on the main weather screen. | `Desc`<br>`Sun`<br>`Humidity`<br>`Last updated` |

**Available Slot Options:**
The following values can be used for `weatherSlot1` through `weatherSlot4`:
- `Desc`
- `Sun`
- `Humidity`
- `Last updated`
- `Pressure`
- `Location`
